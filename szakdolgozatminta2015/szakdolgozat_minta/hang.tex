\section{Goal}\label{sec:INTRO:goal}

I am developing a system that can detect and recognise road signs on pictures taken in real life enviroment. Since there are numerous types of traffic signs and many of them are similar to one another, the task of classifying them is challenging. The recognizability of the road signs is also affected by the following things: luminous intensity, shading, partial coverage, and other obstacles.

There are many similar systems, but the robust cost-effective solution is still an active research subject. Therefore my final goal is to make this system as fast and efficient as possible. This can also be a first step to developing a system that can recognise traffic signs on video files and on live camera feed.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:INTRO:implement}

This system is recognising road signs with machine learning algorithms. I use supervised learning, since I know the desired outcome of an input(the road sign's class), more precisly artificial neural networks.
